# Parcel Tracking

## This was a university project parcel tracking web based application.
## It was originally created using Python Flask, Javascript, HTML, and multiple databases to run both on Google Cloud Services and local hosted via powershell cloud commands.

## This has been refactored to run simply via one free online MongoDB database. It should remain active as long as it is used.
